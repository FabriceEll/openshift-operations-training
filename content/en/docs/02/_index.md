Day 2-operations consist of typical operations tasks after a successful installation such as updating the cluster, making sure your backups work, resizing your cluster to the current capacity needs or replacing failed nodes or even masters.

Before you are going to do just that, we make sure that infrastructure components have their own, dedicated nodes where application workload cannot interfere.
